# Computer Graphics (CAP 4720)

## Overview

Welcome to my **CAP 4720: Computer Graphics** repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my understanding of the core concepts and practical applications of computer graphics, as demonstrated through the projects and assignments I completed during this course. 

The course provides an introduction to **interactive 3D computer graphics programming** using **OpenGL** and **Python**, with a focus on understanding the math and programming techniques behind rendering, shading, and transformations. The primary tool for development in this course is **ModernGL**, a Python wrapper for OpenGL.

This repository highlights the assignments and projects that helped me develop a strong foundation in computer graphics, including working with 3D models, textures, shading, and advanced rendering techniques.
