# Computer Graphics (CAP 4720)

## Overview

Welcome to the **CAP 4720: Computer Graphics** repository! This course covers the fundamentals of interactive 3D computer graphics and 3D graphics programming using **OpenGL** and **Python**. We use **ModernGL**, a Python wrapper for OpenGL, to simplify 3D graphics programming in Python.

The course introduces foundational topics like **Vector Algebra**, **Transformations**, and **Matrix Operations**, which are crucial for 3D graphics.
